<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone</h1>
<h2>My favourite drink is Hong Kong-styled milk tea</h2>
<p>
  The interesting thing is that many Hong Kong people might not be interested in knowing how to make a traditional Hong Kong milk tea! Here I will cover the tutorial about how to make a nice hot milk tea in the UK. As a BNO 5+1 Hong Konger, it will be my honour to be part of the community and I would love to share my own culture in this diverse background in the UK. There are more and more Hong Kong styled cafes in Nottingham. I am not sure if anyone in the UK is aware of it. Currently, there is one famous Hong Kong styled cafe called HOKO based in London. I miss UK so much so that's why I come back. I graduated from the University of Nottingham in 2012.
